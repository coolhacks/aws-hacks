These services operate from 12 geographical regions across the world. The most central and well-known of these services arguably include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, also known as \"EC2\", and Amazon Simple Storage Service, also known as \"S3\". Amazon markets AWS as a service to provide large computing capacity quicker and cheaper than a client company building an actual physical server farm.\r\n\r\nReference: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services)\r\n\r\n# Why aws ?\r\n\r\nWIP(Work in Progress)....\r\n\r\n# Contents:\r\n\r\n* [Docs](https://github.com/coolhacks/aws-hacks/tree/master/docs)\r\n* [Examples](https://github.com/coolhacks/aws-hacks/tree/master/examples)\r\n\r\n# Contributing: \r\n\r\nThis is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:\r\n\r\n- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).\r\n- Make commits of logical units.\r\n- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.\r\n- Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.\r\n- Submit a pull request to the original repository.\r\n\r\nThanks for your contributions!\r\n\r\nCheck out [Contributing](https://github.com/coolhacks/aws-hacks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) section for more details.\r\n\r\n# License:\r\n\r\nThe content of this repo is released under the MIT License by [Ramit Surana](http://twitter.com/ramitsurana).\r\nYou can find a copy of this license in [LICENSE](https://github.com/coolhacks/aws-hacks/blob/master/LICENSE) or at http://opensource.org/licenses/mit.\r\n",
